					<h3><b><i>What does this do?</i></b></h3>
					&#09;This is a digital classroom for students and teachers. The classroom is essentially a chatroom moderated by the teacher. Students may ask questions visible to all students and teachers, but may do so anonymously such that their username is hidden from other students.
				</p>

					<h3><b><i>How is it used?</i></b></h3>
					&#09;This makes managing large class sizes (such as at a university) much easier. It also lets students ask clarifying questions without being afraid of other people thinking their question is "dumb".
				</p>
					&#09;Both teachers and students sign in with their Google account. Then they have access to the classroom, with the teachers having moderating privileges. There may be multiple teachers in a classroom. For example, teacher assistants may help answer questions during class time.

					<h3><b><i>What if they want to stay anonymous?</i></b></h3>
					There is a check box at the top of the chat room that toggles anonymity. Students may check it at any time then post a message to post as "Anonymous".
