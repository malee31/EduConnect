# EduConnect

Welcome to the Github repository for EduConnect created for Hyphen-Hacks 2019.

View the site [here](http://educonnect.ddns.net/).

This is a digital classroom for students and teachers. The classroom is essentially a chatroom moderated by the teacher. Students may ask questions visible to all students and teachers, but may do so anonymously such that their username is hidden from other students. 

This makes managing large class sizes (such as at a university) much easier. It also lets students ask clarifying questions without being afraid of other people thinking their question is "dumb".

Both teachers and students sign in with their Google account. Then they have access to the classroom, with the teachers having moderating privileges. There may be multiple teachers in a classroom. For example, teacher assistants may help answer questions during class time.
